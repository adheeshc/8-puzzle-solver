# 8-puzzle-solver
8 Puzzle solved using BFS

#### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

Create a simple exhaustive search algorithm to solve the 8 Puzzle Problem.

In this project, I have developed a simple 8-piece puzzle solver. The solution for the given puzzle is found using Breadth First Search Algorithm.

The developed system is capable of:

Takes a starting configuration of the puzzle as input
Takes a goal configuration of the puzzle as an inpu
Checks for solvability of the puzzle for a given pair of starting and goal configuration
Generates a solution for a given pair of starting and goal configuration,if a solution exists.

#### **RUN INSTRUCTIONS**

To run the puzzle solver, you can either use the MATLAB functions or the MATLAB App.


#### **OUTPUT DESCRIPTION**
path - prints out the path taken as the final list of nodes

nodes - prints the node number explored as a 1x9 matrix row wise

[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]  =  [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0]
[7 8 0]

node_info - prints parents with its children
